# Djangoâ€™s comment framework has been deprecated and is no longer supported. 
Most users will be better served with a custom solution, or a hosted product like Disqus.
The code formerly known as django.contrib.comments is still available in an external repository.

Quick start guide
- Install the comments frameworks by add "django.contrib.comments' to INSTALLED_APPS
- run migrate to create the comment tables
- Add the comment app's URLs to yours projects 
- Use the comment template tags

Comments template tags
  We interact with the comment system through a series of template tags
  Like all custom template tag libraries, we need to load the custom tags before we use them
  
  {% load comments %}

  Specifying which object comments are attached to
    Django's comments are all "attached" to some parent object. This can be any instance of a Django model. 
    Each of the tags below gives you a couple of different ways you can specify which objects to attach to:
      1/ Refer to the object directly
      
      {% get_comment_count for entry as comment_count %}
      
      2/ Refer to the object by content-type and objet id.
      
      {% get_comment_count for blog.entry as comment_count %}
